She had shaped it into a cone. It smelled... marvelous. He stretched his chin out onto his forefeet and closed his eyes,
 savoring the memory. Shannon didn't have a clue as to why mud would smell marvelous. That's.... nice. I have thought about it, too. 
Not mud, of course -- but having a family. But then... Dooro sensed Miena's depression. Knowing she was an outcast from her own kind and
 unlikely to attract a mate, it occurred to him a distraction was in order. Look, there's my mother with my brothers. Sure enough,
 the mother beaver was swimming across the lake in their direction with her two kits straddling her tail. After passing by a pair of
 ducks also giving rides to their ducklings, they came right up to Miena and Dooro. The beaver kits immediately abandoned their mother
 and began leaping onto Dooro and then tumbling over one another. Boys, behave yourselves, their mother admonished sternly. To Dooro 
she said, Your father and I are about to cut down a big spruce tree. Will you watch your baby brothers? Dooro's eyes twinkled.
 He'd already seen Miena fluff her feathers in anticipation. That will be fine, mother. Maybe I will give them another lesson on
 dam building. The mother beaver smiled her beaver smile and nodded serenely, fully trusting her oldest son. She didn't object to Miena.
 She'd decided it was an odd friendship, but after all, ducks are no threat to beavers. She returned to the water with a gentle slap of
 her tail and Dooro, Miena, and the kits all followed her as far as the dam. Once at the dam Dooro began explaining the fine art of dam 
building. He told them a dam needs to be wider at the bottom than the top. That instead of one big tree being used as a foundation, many
 saplings and limbs of older trees heavy with brush go into the construction. Then branches are laid side by side in line with the
 direction of the current and anchored into the mud by rocks and stones, so as not to wash away. With a web of interlaced branches
 acting like a net, all manner of driftwood and debris are entrapped. Dooro explained that once the foundation is laid, to be watertight
 the dam needs a plaster of mud, pebbles, and grasses and that this plastering of mud must be done on the upstream side first or it will
 wash away. And finally, the heaviest logs are added to the dam on the downstream side and pushed against it at right angles for more
 strength. Being only three weeks old, Dooro's brothers were hardly attentive. They perked up, however, at the mention of mud. We want
 to plaster. Can we do that? they begged. It was what Dooro had in mind. He took them to the bottom of the pond where he showed them how
 to scoop up armfuls of mud, old leaves and pebbles. His forepaws with their five toes and strong claws were particularly dexterous,
 and with the support of his paddle-like tail he could walk on his hind legs underwater. Arms full, Dooro actually walked up the side
 of the eight-foot dam to the surface where he began shoving mud into place with paws and snout.
